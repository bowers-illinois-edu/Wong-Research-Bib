		  black empowerment and racial turnout rates in Atlanta
		  (Georgia), Cleveland (Ohio), and Los Angeles (California).
		  Symbolic politics, intergroup competition, and political
		  alienation theories are used to explain interracial
		  differences in political participation in mayoral
		  elections. Strong and durable symbolic effects are evident
		  in all three cases. Black turnout equals or exceeds white
		  turnout during and, in the case of Cleveland, after the
		  period of black empowerment. In Los Angeles, however, the
		  symbolic benefits of black empowerment eventually wane as a
		  result of increasing political alienation among black
		  voters.},

  abstract	= {We use longitudinal data incorporating three generations
		  of Americans to reevaluate the character and consequences
		  of political socialization within the family. Findings
		  about parental influence based on youth coming of age in
		  the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized
		  in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning
		  theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents'
		  political orientations if the family is highly politicized
		  and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The
		  direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an
		  extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental
		  characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult
		  political development.},

  abstract	= {Freedman [Adv. in Appl. Math. 40 (2008a) 180--193; Ann.
		  Appl. Stat. (2008b) 2 176--196] critiqued OLS regression
		  adjustment of estimated treat- ment effects in randomized
		  experiments, using Neyman's model for random- ization
		  inference. This paper argues that in sufficiently large
		  samples, the sta- tistical problems he raised are either
		  minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment improves or does not
		  hurt asymptotic precision when the regression includes a
		  full set of treatment-covariate interactions.
		  Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be
		  constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error
		  estimator. Even the traditional OLS adjustment has benign
		  large-sample prop- erties when subjects are randomly
		  assigned to two groups of equal size. The strongest reasons
		  to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates
		  are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

		  edition of {\&}#191;Observational Studies{\&}#191; is about

		  observational studies (Chapter 11) and Chapter 9, on

		  black political participation is limited. We test this
		  proposition using the 1993---1994 National Black Politics
		  Study. Our findings suggest long-term political
		  incorporation decreases local black political participation
		  while it increases voting for President. However, as the
		  black population percentage of a city rises, local black
		  political participation increases. These findings extend
		  the research on the effect of political incorporation on

  abstract	= {This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their
		  communities and the extent to which their communities'
		  boundaries determine who they believe should benefit from
		  the government's resources via redistributive policies. By
		  contributing extensive empirical analyses to a largely
		  theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective nature
		  of communities while confronting the elusive task of
		  pinning down "pictures in people's heads." A deeper
		  understanding of people's definitions of their communities
		  and how they affect feelings of duties and obligations
		  provides a new lens through which to look at diverse
		  societies and the potential for both civic solidarity and
		  humanitarian aid. This book analyzes three different types
		  of communities and more than eight national surveys. Wong
		  finds that the decision to help only those within certain
		  borders and ignore the needs of those outside rests, to a
		  certain extent, on whether and how people translate their
		  sense of community into obligations.
		  
		  Book Description Based on analysis of three types of
		  communities and eight national surveys, this book examines
		  how ordinary Americans imagine their communities. Wong
		  concludes that people's definition of their community and
		  delineation of its boundaries shape their views on
